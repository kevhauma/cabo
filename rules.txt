general rules/goal

each card has a value
red king is best card: -1
Ace to Black King -> 1 to 13
Joker is 0 points

goal: get as little score as possible (or make your opponents score higher)

playstyle:
- memorise cards across the board,
- swap with potential better cards

special features: 
- Black King: swap with opponent (look at your card, then opponent card, can decline)
- Jack and Queen: swap with opponent (no looky at your or opponent card)
- 9-10: peak at opponent card
- 7-8: peak at own card



start with 4 cards, can have more or less
all the cards are face down, except the open card

stack -> remaining card pile
open card -> last one added to discard pile
discard pile -> becomes open card

preparation stage:
-> player gets 4 hidden cards
-> player looks at one of their cards
-> if card "matches" open card, they can discard it


round stage:
 - take open card, add it to your cards

 - take card from stack and look at it
	- swap with your card
	- "use" card (if special feature)

when open card changes (or player isn't actively swapping/looking at card)
other players can "match" their card with the open card and discard them

any mistakes: take another card

ending stage:
- player calls "swish swish", wiggles cards (just visual?)
- remaining players continue one more round 
	- no interaction with swish caller
	- can call swish themselves (to avoid being messed with by remaining players)


remaining questions:
how do cards "match"? numbers, colors, suit? ON VALUE
can that happen any round/between player switches or only at start

what happends with cards that the special feature is used? back to the back of the stack
does it become the open card? BECOMES OPEN CARD

when the open card is taken? what replaces it? a card from the stack? 
OPEN CARD BENEATH IT (if no card beneath, take one from the stack)

(only applicable in online version)
opponent sees what card is being peaked at?
